## Brunch 0.9.0 (unreleased)
* Added new API for plugins.
* Added support for Jade, LESS and Roy. All language compilers / plugins are
now located in separate repo,
[brunch-extensions](https://github.com/brunch/brunch-extensions).
* CoffeeScript (instead of YAML) is now used for application configs.
* Improved file watcher speed by 5-fold.
* Implemented new directory structure:
    * The build directory is now generated automatically.
    * All assets (index.html, images etc.) are placed in app/assets/.
    * `main.coffee` was renamed to `initialize.coffee` for clarity.
    * `src/vendor` and `src/app` moved to `vendor` and `app`.
    * All scripts from `src/vendor` are moved to `app/vendor/scripts`.
    * Added support for CoffeeScript in `vendor/scripts`.
    * Added support for Stylus / LESS in `vendor/styles`.
    * Templates have moved from `app/templates` to `app/views/templates`.
* Updated command line API:
    * `brunch build` and `brunch watch` now compile files in current working
    directory (instead of in `./brunch/` subdir).
    * Added `brunch generate` command. It's basically a shortcut for creating new
    model / view / router. Example usage: `brunch generate view user`.
    * Added `brunch watch --server` flag that would run http server on
    build directory. It has an optional `--port` setting.
* Added support for node 0.6.
* Added growl support.
* Changed reset.styl to normalize.css & helpers.css from html5boilerplate.
* Improvements for vendor data: support CSS in vendor/styles directory,
support CoffeeScript (in addition to js) in vendor/scripts directory.
* Add firebug support to stylus compiler.
* Improved time formatting in console logs.
