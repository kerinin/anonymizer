Description
-----------

* ``Cakefile`` is a coffeescript makefile.
* ``config.coffee`` contains configuration of your app. You can set plugins / languages that would be used here.
* ``app/assets`` contains images / static files. Contents of the directory would be copied to ``build/`` without change.
* Other ``app/`` directories could contain files that would be compiled. Languages, that compile to JS (coffeescript, roy etc.) or js files and located in ``app`` are automatically wrapped in module closure so they can be loaded by ``require('module/location')``.
* ``build`` is generated automatically, so you don't need to put anything there.
* ``test/`` contains feature & unit tests.
* ``vendor`` contains all third-party code. The code wouldn't be wrapped in modules, it would be loaded instantly instead.
