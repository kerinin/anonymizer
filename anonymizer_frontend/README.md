Frontend Basics
========

This frontend was generated by `brunch`, and generally follows the conventions
used in the scaffolding and the [brunch todos sample application](https://github.com/brunch/todos).

This README will probably get obsolete pretty quick - refer to `config.coffee` to see 
what libraries are being used, and possibly `package.json` to see what's being used
for development.
